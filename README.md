# Project Overview
This repository contains a ROS2-based mobile robot navigation system developed as part of the Mobile Robots (SoSe 2025) course at TU Dortmund University.

The project integrates global path planning and local trajectory optimization to enable autonomous navigation of a TurtleBot3 in a simulated lab environment using Gazebo and RViz.

# Key Features
ROS2-based navigation stack

TurtleBot3 simulation in Gazebo

Goal-based navigation using RViz

Global path planning using:

Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT)

Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM)

Local trajectory optimization using:

Timed Elastic Band (TEB)

Real-time obstacle avoidance

Visualization of the map, robot pose, goal, and planned paths

# Navigation Architecture
Map Representation
The lab environment is represented as a binary occupancy grid map.

Global Planning
A collision-free path is generated from the robot’s current pose to the goal using RRT or PRM.

Local Planning (TEB)
The global path is optimized in space and time while respecting the robot’s kinematic and dynamic constraints.

Control Execution
Velocity commands are generated and published to the /cmd_vel topic to drive the robot.

# Requirements

ROS2 (Humble or compatible)

TurtleBot3 packages

# Running the Simulation
1. Build the workspace
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash

2. Launch TurtleBot3 simulation
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_rst_lab.launch.py

3️. Start navigation
ros2 launch turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2_rst_lab.launch.py use_sim_time:=True

4️. Set initial pose and goal
Use 2D Pose Estimate in RViz to set the robot’s initial pose
Use 2D Goal Pose to send a navigation goal

# Results
The robot successfully navigates from the start pose to the goal while avoiding obstacles and following a smooth, dynamically feasible trajectory generated by the TEB local planner.
